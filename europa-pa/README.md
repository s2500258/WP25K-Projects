# Europa-pa, a little fun game site that guesses a country that you were thinkikng of.

1. The user mentally thinks of any country located in Europe and presses the Start button (by "country" we mean an independent state recognized by the UN).
It is advisable to choose a country about which the user knows enough information to have minimal need to resort to additional search. But still, if user doesn't know an answer to certain quastion it's totally OK to google it. 

2. Then the site will ask the user a series of questions with two possible answers: YES and NO. If the user is not sure of the answer,  it is allowed to use the search.

3. If the user answered all the questions correctly, then at the end the site will give the country the user thought of. If he made mistakes, the site will report that it could not determine what the user thought of.
